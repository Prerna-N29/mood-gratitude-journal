# mood-gratitude-journal
This is my first project to work on.
As a beginner to all of this, it seems to be difficult at the start of it but it will progress to better.

This WEB APP is basically created to:
- To jot down what we feel thankful about that particular day.
- To mark with emoji to depict how our mood is.

Techstack:
- HTML : the skeleton of the web app
- CSS : to style the wep app
- JAVASCRIPT : to let users interact with the web app
